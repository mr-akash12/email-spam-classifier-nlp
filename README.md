# 📧 Email Spam Classifier using NLP & Streamlit

An end-to-end **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project that classifies incoming emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using Machine Learning.  
The project is deployed as an **interactive Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of an NLP-based text classification model — from text cleaning and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

It uses **NLTK** for text processing, **TF-IDF** for feature extraction, and a **Naive Bayes classifier** for spam detection.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Clean and preprocess raw email text using NLP techniques.
- Convert text to numeric vectors with TF-IDF.
- Train ML models to detect spam emails.
- Interactive Streamlit interface for user input and instant predictions.
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1-score.

## 🧩 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded dataset: `spam-1(in).csv`
- Removed unwanted columns and null values.
- Tokenized and normalized text using:
  - **Stopword removal**
  - **Stemming (PorterStemmer)**
  - **Lemmatization (WordNetLemmatizer)**
- Converted text to lowercase and removed punctuation/special characters.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Transformed cleaned text into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**.

### 3. Model Training
- Trained **Naive Bayes** classifier (MultinomialNB) for binary text classification.
- Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 4. Evaluation
- Evaluated model performance with metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

### 5. Deployment (Streamlit)
- Created an interactive UI using **Streamlit**.
- User can input an email text → app predicts whether it’s *Spam* or *Ham*.
- Simple and lightweight web interface.
- 
📊 Results

Model: Multinomial Naive Bayes

Accuracy: ~97–99% (depending on dataset and parameters)

Precision & Recall: High performance in identifying spam messages.
